    "## Introduction:\n",
    "In this project, At first, we inspected data and cleaned it and normalize it for maximum accuracy. The next step was to implement a Bayesian network with 2 classes and a bag of word method to calculate words probabilities on the clean dataset. Then I implemented the network on a classification with 3 classes and used the model to classify some unknown data and got a good accuracy by checking with the original dataset in Kaggle.com."

    "## Question:\n",
    "In this project we are asked to classify news category based on it's sgort description and headline. The solution is to implement Naive Bayes which is a simple Bayesian Network having one node of class and some other nodes representing features that are only connected to class node meaning that they are independent from each other. Another method used in this project is bag of words which is considering probbility of word regardless of their position in sentence. It means that probability of word to appear in any position in sentence is consistent. Now let's tell remaining explanations by analyzing code:"

It could be seen that there are some rows with no descriptions so I removed them due to project circumstances. The other thing that we can understand is that there are 3 type of news categories in the dataset: Business and Travel and Style and Beauty.

    "Next step is cleaning data which i had written a function called cleanData for this purpose. It combines headline and short description each row and put it in text column and then lowercase all of the letters in the text and spliting them by non alphabetic characters. The next step was to convert word to their root format using nlkt librry methods stemming and lemmatizating. I used both of them nd got almost same answers (stemming was better a little bit so I used it). All of these actions are necessary in order t get an accurate answer. If we didn't lowercased all of our words there would be many versions of a word  with same value for us and in the state of probability calculation it will make our accuracy worse. A simple example for this would be the word money and Money which need to have same probability for business class but seperating them would split their probabilities and will lower the probability of this world. Another part of cleaning is converting word to their root. We could use stemming and lemmatizating. Stemming will only remove prefix and postixes, ing's , s's and things like this but won't change the format of verbs to their root like lemmatizating. In general it is a weaker method but it works better here. Another part of the data cleaning is removing word that are used alot in texts such as this, that, the and ... and won't help us in our classification method. I checked esults without lowercasing and root finding and each one decreased accuracy at least 10%."

The reason for that is to train our model to classify both classes and it needs a normal data for that but randomness of our selection could cause problem by assigning 70% of business class and 90% of travel class and it could make our classifier biased."

Likelihood is reverse of this probability meaning that it is probability of texts containing words equal to x if news category is c. Class prior probability is the probability of a news category publishing across all of the news published which is given to us ny an expert of this field. In this case I used the numbers of thisdataset on kaggle which had more than 200k of news data. Last one is predictor prior probability which is probability of a text cinsisting of set of word equal to x in general which we don't calculate in this project because we want to valculate maximum posterior probability between classes and this element is constant in all of classes and wouldn't affect the result."

    " A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classifier on a set of test data for which the true values are known. It allows the visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Most performance measures are computed from the confusion matrix. The confusion matrix shows the ways in which your classification model is confused when it makes predictions. It gives us insight not only into the errors being made by a classifier but more importantly the types of errors that are being made. The first column of this table shows number of data that classifier classified as travel and each row of this column is actual number of data classified as travel, by each category. It means that the left top of table shows number of data that was actualy travel and classifier predicted it Travel. It is better for us to have higher numbers in diameter and lower in other cells. It could be seen that there are many data that are predicted style and beauty falsely."

    "It could be seen that precision and recall of business class have a noticable difference and its reason is that number of business classes for training are lower than other classes so our word dictionary for this class is weaker and if a new word appear in our test it is more possible that it is available in the better-trained classes. Another thing is that when we add random data from current dataset data with higher probability is more probable to be chosen to add so its probability will increase and data with lower probability will be less probable. There are some ways to handle this like oversampling, undersampling, SMOTE and ... . The method we use here is oversampling in which we choose random rows from train data and add them to the train so that its population gets closer to other classes. This action will increase probability of each word meaning that weaker classes will be chosen more often. Adding about a 1000 rows almost equalize this evaluation metrics for all classes. Accuracy and recall don't change much but precision for business class gets better. An important point in oversapling is that train and test should be splitted before this becuse if you add from test to train it will discredit the result."

    "The tf-idf weight a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the dataset. This weight is computed by finding product of term frequency (tf) and inverse document frequency. Term Frequency indicates the number of occurences of a particular term t in document d. We can see that as a term appears more in the document it becomes more important, which is logical. We need to normalize it by by dividing it by total number of words. The idf of a term is the number of documents in the dataset divided by the document frequency of a term. Term frequency is the occurrence count of a term in one particular document only; while document frequency is the number of different documents the term appears in, so it depends on the whole dataset. Itâs expected that the more frequent term to be considered less important, but the factor (most probably integers) seems too harsh. Therefore, we take the logarithm (with base 2 ) of the inverse document frequencies. The last step is to calculate product of these two measures for each word. In order to use this measure we could have used it instead of likelihood that we calculated in previous steps.\n",
    "#### 3-\n",
    "Prescision is an important evaluation measure but it is not enough and focusing on just this measure will cause problem; Our model could be riskless and classify only items that is sure about them and this will decrease accuracy and recall. For example if we have a classifier for ham and spam detection and we choose only one email as spam that has the highest probability we will probably get precision of 100% but accuracy and recall will be very low. If precision for all classes of classifier are high then our classifier has worked realy well because we have classified all of data and did it flawless so accuracy and recall will also be high.\n",
    "#### 4-\n",
    "If a word appears in train in one class only, in the step that we want calculate probability of each class for test data the class containing this word will get a high probability and other classes will get a small number( 10^-4) that will make them less probable and data will probably be classified as category containing spoken word."
